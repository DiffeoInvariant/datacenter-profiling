This project provides a low-overhead\footnote{Even if the data collecting programs have generated over 20,000 total entries, the program uses less than 500 kB of network data (i.e. transmits < 500 kB over the network).} option to profile the network usage of an MPI program and transmit the results to a remote user via a REST API (including browser-friendly HTML). It does not require the user to recompile their code, only to run the data collection programs and then the server before running their program. This could be done explicitly on the command-line or in a batch script, running the data collection programs and server in the background. Furthermore, even an inexperienced user should be able to extend this code to collect more detailed data if so desired.
